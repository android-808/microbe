microbe
=======

Microbe is an attempt to recreate Maemo 5's microb using embedlite and Qt.

Unfortunately as of 1/2 Feb 2014 the QT4 backend in embedlite has been removed. As a result it is not possible to update the backend beyond that point at present.

Once Qt5 is stablised for the N900/Neo900, the backend will be updated again.
